# What is Sentinel 1's SAR sensor?


---

# How does it work?


---

# How is it used in academic research?

- Ollie Ballingers's PWTT research on building damage detection
- Ban et al. (2020) on using Sentinel SAR data to train a deep neural network classifier for near-real time fire detection 


---
# How can SAR be used for near real-time fire detection

---

# Trying it out on historic wild fires in California

- What am i trying to do maybe add in the flow diagram of the analysis.
- Another bullet point

---
# Initial results on testing the SNNs on the SAR images
